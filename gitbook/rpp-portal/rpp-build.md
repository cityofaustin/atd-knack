## About the application

The Residential Parking Permit Program (RPP) application has two main URLS:

### What RPP Staff have access to

* They will have access to the following tabs:&#x20;

    * Customers
      * This page has the columns in a weird order, can be changed after RPP migration is completed. Ask Steve if he has a preference.
