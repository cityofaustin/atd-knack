5. Navigate to and open the "**Customers\_COLOR\_TEMPLATE**" spreadsheet file and 'Save As' "**Customers\_COLOR**" with the appropriate color zone you are working with. Save to the **"import\_tables"** folder. Navigate and open the existing "**Customers\_COLOR**" spreadsheet file if it already exists. Fields to configure:
   * Name
   * Name of Applicant: First
   * Name of Applicant: Middle
   * Name of Applicant: Last
   * Phone
   * Email

10. Go through the "**Revenue\_Permits\_2020\_**_**COLOR**_**\_ZONE**" spreadsheet file and transpose any relevant notes and comments from each row into the 'Notes' column on the "**Customers\_COLOR**" spreadsheet file such as purchase date info, address info, or tenant names. If the information from these excel comments and notes are phone numbers, transpose them to the 'Phone' column on the "**Customers\_COLOR**" spreadsheet file
11. If the original record has a property management company as the name yet there is a comment or note that has the owner name for the record, go ahead and replace the business name with the owner name as the 'Full Name'
12. Once all name, phone, email, and notes information has been copied over to the "**Customers\_COLOR**" spreadsheet file, you may close the "**Revenue\_Permits\_2020\_**_**COLOR**_**\_ZONE**" spreadsheet file
13. On the "**Customers\_COLOR**" spreadsheet file look for multiple customer names in the 'Full Name' column (hint: use 'Find and Search' for all "&" or "and" in the name), reference the first email in the 'Email' field and use the associated customer name as the primary 'Full Name' and remove any other names from the cell. Remove any additional emails from the 'Email' cell that are not the primary email
14. Organize the spreadsheet alphabetically by the 'Full Name' column
15. Check the 'Full Name' field for duplicate customer records and remove the row that features less information. If otherwise the same in all fields, choose either row to remove
16. With the 'Phone' column, 'Find & Replace' all .(dots) with -(dashes) in all phone numbers
17. Either copy/paste or enter the 'Name of Applicant: First', 'Name of Applicant: Middle', and 'Name of Applicant: Last' information from the 'Full Name' column for all records
18. Lastly, go through every record and verify all fields are formatted and entered correctly. Save file

* **Name** - The concatenated 'customer ID | customer name' from the "Customer Export" spreadsheet
* **Renewal Year** - Actually a month value. The same value for the entire zone
* **Permit Type** - One of 3 types: 'Residential Parking Permit | decal', Residential Parking Permit | hang tag', or 'Day Pass'
* **Total Day Passes** - The total number of Day Passes for that customer. If more than 20, create a new record for the remaining day passes and corresponding serial numbers
* **Serial Numbers** - The 4 or 5 digit serial number that corresponds with an individual pass. For Day Passes, this value will be a range of serial number that corresponds with the total number of Day passes
* **Issued Date** - Is actually the 'Date Received' value for the customer application
* **Date Received** - FIELD NOT USED IN IMPORT. Copied to the 'Issued Date' column
* **Total Permits** - FIELD NOT USED IN IMPORT. Total of Decal and Hang Tag permits. You may update to include the Day Passes in the total as reference but be aware this column will be removed.

### Configure "Permits" Spreadsheet

Each record should have an association between the application and permit

1. On both the **"Permits\_COLOR"** spreadsheet and **"Customer Export"** spreadsheet, make sure your records are ordered alphabetically. This will allow us to match the Name to the Name field on the **"Customer Export"** spreadsheet that includes the concatenated Customer ID for each Name as well as the Application ID in the 'permit\_applications' column. Fields to configure:
   * Issued By
   * permit\_applications (do not rename field)
   * Name
   * Renewal Year
   * Permit Type
   * Total Day Passes
   * Serial Numbers
   * Issued Date
2.  On the **"Permits\_COLOR"** spreadsheet select the row number for each record and right click and insert ('I' key) for how many total permits there are for that customer. So if total permits for a customer is 4, you will need to insert 3 additional rows below that record so we can separate each permit for all customers

    Note: For Day Passes, we will only dedicate one row for each grouping of up to 20 day passes&#x20;
3. Add 2 more columns, 'Issued By' as column 'A' and 'permit\_applications' as column 'B' in front of the 'Name' column
4. For the 'Issued By' column, fill in your name (Knack RPP Reviewer or Builder Admin) and drag the cell to fill in the column for all records
5.  For the 'permit\_applications' field, we will need to enter the 8 digit Permit Application number. (This permit application number may need to change to a 9 digit number should the number of applications exceed 10,000 in a given year). The Permit Application number and the Name with the concatenated Application ID (appID) can both be found and transposed from the  **"Customer Export"** spreadsheet. Copy both the corresponding Application ID in the 'permit\_applications' column and the corresponding Name in the 'Name' column over the old 'Name' value for all records

    **Note:** Some customers may have more than one application associated with them
6. For 'Renewal Year' column select or enter 2 cells worth of values, select both, and drag that selection with the bottom right square to apply to the entire column since renewal year will be the same for all customers in the same zone
7. Skip over 'Permit Type', 'Total Day Passes', and 'Serial Numbers" columns for now
8. Transpose the 'Date Received' value over to the 'Issued Date' column next to it on the same record row for all records with 'Date Received'
9. (Optional) Make sure the 'Total Permits' column displays accurately the total number of permits when referencing for your record rows
10. Select the row number for each record and right click and insert ('I' key) for how many total permits there are for that customer. Naturally the insert function will insert a row above the selected record so you can either start from bottom to top or simply just skip the first record row. So if 'Total Permits' for a customer is 4, you will need to insert 3 additional rows below that record so we can separate each permit for all customers

    **Note:** For Day Passes, we will only dedicate one row for each grouping of up to 20 day passes
11. Copy each customer record row or columns 'A' to 'H' for each customer record, select all corresponding empty rows below that customer and paste. Do for all records.
12. Transpose the Decal Serial Numbers, Hang-Tag Serial Numbers, and Day Pass Serial Numbers from the right columns (columns 'K' to 'O') to their individual rows under 'Serial Numbers' column 'G'. You may copy and paste, manually enter, or use the 'Fill Series' option to transpose serial numbers. Remember to just paste the range of serial numbers for up to 20 day passes on its specific row.

    **Note:** If a customer is associated with multiple applications, be sure that the corresponding serial numbers match accordingly
13. Enter the 'Total Day Passes' column with the total day pass values from column 'O' 'Day Passes' on the specific last row for that customer name where the Day Pass Serial Numbers are entered in the 'Serial Numbers' column 'G'
14. For the 'Permit Type' column, now enter the value 'Day Pass' on each respective record row that has the 'Total Day Passes' and 'Serial Numbers' for Day Passes
15. For the 'Permit Type' column, now enter the value 'Residential Parking Permit | decal' for each respective record row that has 'Serial Numbers' for only Decal Permits
16. For the 'Permit Type' column, now enter the value 'Residential Parking Permit | hang tag' for each respective record row that has 'Serial Numbers' for only Hang Tag Permits (the remaining empty cells in the 'Permit Type' column)
17. Double check and verify all copied or entered data matches accordingly
18. Remove all reference columns from the spreadsheet, columns 'I' through 'Q' to finalize the spreadsheet. Save file
19. Rename the file to "**Permits\_COLOR\_#**" where # is the number of permit records to be imported and 'Save As' a .csv file. Be sure not to include the title row in the number of records.
