# Troubleshooting: FAQs

## Most common questions from Finance staff

### _Can I ask your assistance in Knack PR 2020-04-1647 can you advise how to make a correction to ID 2116, I need to delete this invoice and enter into the PR that it was supposed to be posted too._

### _I did an error in Knack PR 2020-0401647, ID 2116 needs to me deleted_

The user has a Purchase Request (PR) and they have associated an "invoice" record to it and they can't delete it. The child record "Received Items" (Invoice Item), needs to be disassociated from the invoice in order for the "**Delete button**" to appear.

### _I**f you could check why PR 2020-04-1679 did not close? membership was paid in full? When I entered the invoice the PR was in green stage, and I noticed that other are in Orange why is this?**_

I'm looking at the PR. I think you need to submit the Process Purchasing Request form and put a status decision.

It's currently blank. The final status for this step is to select "Processing Complete" and click the "Submit" button_**. **_

So what I noticed is that you receive the PR in a "`Processing- Purchasing`" status, but since you're also doing the Account Payable (AP) work you don't move it to the next status before you add the invoices information. So that step is being left out so I think that's the reason the PR's aren't closing as you're expecting it to.&#x20;

### _**I entered the information to PR 2019-1095, all funds were used but PR still shows in green.**_

okay, I think it's because you need to have the Invoices marked as Final Payment = Yes

### _**Could you remove Invoice ID 45256 from the PR we were working on last week, PR 2019-1037, there is no receiver for me to remove which would then enable me to remove the invoice myself.**_

So I found the received item, it wasn't associated to the PR. I associated it, so now you can delete the Received Item ID 652/Invoice # 45256. Then delete the invoice.
