## Process:

1. User gets links to training documents to review content: Finance and Purchasing System TRAINING SLIDES
2. User normally emails back and says they're ready for the quiz, Van or I email the user the link to [create an account/quiz:](https://atd.knack.com/finance-purchasing#create-quiz/)
3. User emails back that they're done with the quiz, Van or I review the [quiz submissions](https://atd.knack.com/finance-purchasing#results/)

* We also ask the user if they haven't mentioned if they are going to be an approver or not
  *  `Approver`: Yes/No - this would allow them to approve purchase requests \(PR\)

1. If the user passes, we go to their [account details page](https://atd.knack.com/finance-purchasing#results/account-administration/)
2. We edit the [users record](https://atd.knack.com/finance-purchasing#results/account-administration/edit-account/5bd08db061e8cf20717cd9f7/)
3. Change `User Status` from "inactive" to "active"
