# Sources for Monthly Trip Records

## Sources

There are two sources that populate records in the _monthly\_trips_ object. 

1. An ETL process that adds new records from the MDS feed on the 3rd of every month. \(Created By - ETL Access\).
2. New records that the Shared Mobility Team members add if the provider is not included in the MDS feed. \(Created By - Logged in team member\).
