# Sources for Monthly Trip Records

#### Sources

There are two sources that populate records in the _monthly\_trips_ object.&#x20;

1. An ETL process that adds new records for each provider for that month from the MDS feed on the 3rd of every month. This only includes providers included in the MDS feed.(Hint : Created By - ETL Access).
2. New records that the Shared Mobility Team members add if the provider is not included in the MDS feed. (Hint : Created By - Logged in team member).
