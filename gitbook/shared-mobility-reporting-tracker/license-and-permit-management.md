# License & Permit Management

## ABOUT LICENSES & PERMITS

A license is tied to a provider account. This is where the license start and end period can be entered. These dates will be the primary start/end dates to the permits associated to the provider.

A provider can hold multiple permits. A permit must be issued if the provider is choosing to deploy devices in a different geographic area. If they decide to change the amount of devices and/or the geographic area a new permit must be issued.

Ex. 100 devices in DAPCZ

* the provider DOESN'T want to change the location or number of devices, than this permit can be renewed.
* the provider DOES want to change either the location or the number of devices, a new permit needs to be created
  * Provider wants to add 50 more units to a geographic area - _150 in DAPCZ_
  * Provider wants to deploy 100 units in new zone, Zone 1 - _100 in Zone 1_

## ADD A LICENSE

When you add a Provider, there is a section when you enter the **Start Date** and **Expiration Date** for the provider. This "provider" record generates a License ID number and that license will be tied to the provider. The duration Start/Expiration dates determine the license period.&#x20;

### Steps on how to - [ADD A NEW PROVIDER](https://atd-dts.gitbook.io/atd-knack-operations/shared-mobility-operations/application-overview#add-a-new-provider)

## ADD A PERMIT

1\. From the "View Providers Details page"

2\. Click the "**Add Permit**" button

3\. Fill out the Permit information on the form:

* **Device Type:** the type of dock-less mobility device
* **Number of Devices:** the number of units being deployed&#x20;
* **Amount Paid:** The amount the permit will be (custom amount because can prorate permit amounts)
* **Zone:** The geographic zone/area that the provider will be deploying units
* **Notes:** any additional notes about the permit
* **Permit Start Date:** This is the first date the permit started regardless of the renewal cycle or the license renewal period.
* `RENEWAL PERIOD - for BACK DATING` - this field is to indicate whether or not a permit is in the Renewal Period allowing a user to access the "Renewal" button. This should be used only if adding historical permits. Should remove from form once licenses & permits are update for all providers.
* `EXPIRED - for BACK DATING` - This is used when entering historical permits, to indicate
* **Permit Expiration Date:** The date the permit should expire

4\. Click the “**Submit**” button to submit the form.

## RENEW PERMIT(S) & LICENSE

Each Provider/License record has a **Start Date** and **Expiration Date** associated, the system will run a task to change the permit field "Renewal Period" (Yes/No). If the Expiration date is within the current month and the permit is active it'll switch the "Renewal Period" to "Yes".&#x20;

An email task is set up so that a provider is notified by email 30 days before the Provider's Expiration date. The provider should communicate with the SMS team to determine which permits to "renew" and which to "set to expire".&#x20;

This allows the staff (or Provider, depending on the SMS team) to renew the permits they would like or set them to expire.&#x20;

After the permits have been added, renewed or set to expire the SMS team can go to the License Renewal at the bottom of the page.&#x20;

When the user clicks "Start License Renewal Process" button a dialog box will appear asking if they have reviewed all the permits up for renewal.  &#x20;

If a user clicks "**No**", the dialog box will disappear and the user must review the permits and add, renew or set to expire any licenses.&#x20;

If a user click "**Yes**", will continue with the renewal process.

The form will ask you to enter the **Start Date** and the **Expiration Date** for the new license renewal cycle.
