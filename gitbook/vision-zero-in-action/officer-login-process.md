# Login Process for Officers

## Purpose

To enable officers to login to the VZA application with Active Directory credentials. Using Active Directory credentials to log in to the application will allow them to sign up for assignments, get notifications, and be able to access the assignments they signed up for.

## Permissions

A user with an Officer role in the application and  APD Active Directory credentials  will be able to carry out this process.

## Account creation process

Officers will attend an introductory training session and then register to create an account in the application at [http://bit.ly/apd-vza](http://bit.ly/apd-vza).&#x20;

The username should be _firstname.lastname@austintexas.gov._&#x20;

They will receive a link to the application after creating the account.
