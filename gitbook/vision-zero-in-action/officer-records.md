# Officer Records

## Deleted Officer Records

If an officer has signed up for assignments, and the user record is deleted, this could cause the tables listing officer assignments on the Sign Up and My Assignments pages to fail. The table will look like it is loading and continue to spin. This happens because the filters and custom code required to make the Sign Up function for multiple assignments at one time, fail when information like officer name, or location is blank.
