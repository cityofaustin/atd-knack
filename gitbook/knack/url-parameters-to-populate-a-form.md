Here's what is super frustrating, the encoder link the documentation included was changing spaces to `+` instead of `%20`.

[https://www.urlencoder.org/](https://www.urlencoder.org/) &lt;-- this link will change the spaces to `%20`

Didn't include square brackets since the fields didnt appear to be connected fields, but i am not sure it made a difference with or without brackets
