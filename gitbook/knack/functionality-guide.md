* CSVs larger than 250 MB cannot be imported. CSVs should be broken down into subsets of around 10,000 records to help import times and prevent time-outs. 
* Number of fields can affect import times, especially with large amounts of data. Empty fields still need to be indexed, so removing empty fields could improve import times.

2. "equation" field type
3. formula: `getDateMonth({CREATED_DATE})`
