# Importing Records

## Connections 

### Check all field types and fix during import 

this will make life easier once the object is created, instead of changing the field types after creation

### Importing connection fields

* connect to `text formula` that is of the connection - connection field
* can't connect directly to a connection field, the import won't work.
