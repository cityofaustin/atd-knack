# Asset Changes

When we have an asset that needs to be converted from an PHB to a Signal and we want to retain the records of the PHB, but won't use the PHB any longer we do the following:

1. Edit the PHB, change the status to `REMOVED PERMANENTLY`

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

2\. Find the `Location ID` that the PHB was located&#x20;

3\. Create a new asset (Signal) there and it will auto generate a `Signal ID`
