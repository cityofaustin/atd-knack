# Creating CSR Page components

After the 3 main CSR tables are created:&#x20;

* csr\_issues
* csr\_activities
* csr\_flex\_notes

The fun part begins creating the table/page/form components

* [ ] Main CSR Service Request page - this will have the `csr_issues` records that are broken up by the Issue Type
* [ ] Service Request Details page - this page has many components
* [ ] Embeded web map that locates the address and places a map marker on the map based on the CSR Address (will require some modification of JavaScript)
* [ ] Activity Form - (New form)
* [ ] Activity table
* [ ] Flex Notes - modal page
* [ ] Other components - like creation of work order
