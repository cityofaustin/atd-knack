# Data set inventory

If you need to create a new data set or modify an existing data set, please follow the steps outlined below.

### Creating a new data set

* Open the [Data and Technology Services Portal](https://atd.knack.com/dts)
* Navigate to [Data Inventory - Datasets](https://atd.knack.com/dts#datasets/). 
* Click `+ New Dataset`

Fields to populate:

* **Dataset Name** - Please make sure that the data set name used is the final production name 
  * For example - `Data and Technology Services Portal | PRODUCTION`
* **Description** - Typically we use this description as the production description we use for data set meta data used on ex. \(GISDM\)
* **Notes** - Any special notes on the creation of the data set, discrepancies, disclaimer of quality, etc...
* **Owner Department** - The identified department who is the data manager \(Should be defaulted to "ATD"\)
* **Geometry Type** - If this data set is not spatial, there is an option for "non-spatial"
* **Technical Contact** - The individual or group that is the primary data manager
* **Business Contact** - If there is a power user or primary business stakeholder of the data set 
  * _\(There is functionality to add a new contact person if they're not listed\)_
* **Division** - The identified division that the data set may belong to
* **Tags** - Categories to help identify a data subset

Click the **Submit** Button.

### Modifying a data set

* Search for the data set on the inventory list.
* Click on the hyperlinked Details icon in the Details field.
* In addition to application details, this page also provides information about
  * **Dataset Instances** - datasets in various instances

  * Yes
  * No
* **Source Instance** - This references the data sets that exist in the dataset inventory
* **Host Application** - This references the applications that exist in the application inventory \(below are some examples\)
  * GISMAINTDEV
  * GISMAINT1
  * GISDM
  * File Geodatabase
  * Feature Service
  * CSR 311
