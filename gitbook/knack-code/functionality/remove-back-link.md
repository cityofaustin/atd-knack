# Remove Back Links

![Example Back Link](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (153).png>)

There may be instances where this back link detracts from the user experience. One such example is within an multi-page application process where a user should not be able to navigate back or maybe a parent page you do not want users to access.

### The JS

None needed ðŸ˜Ž

### The CSS

```
#kn-scene_309 .kn-back-link {
  display: none;
}
```

### How to Implement

Adjust the Scene ID and you are set!
