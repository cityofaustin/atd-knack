# Contractor Work Order Tracking

**Problem**: Signs and Markings needed a way to track contractor work orders and wanted to track it in the same system where they track their existing Signs and Markings work orders.&#x20;

**Solution**: Add an area to the SMB Tracker for Contractor tracking

## Build Information

#### New! Object tables created

* `contract_vendor` (just Contract Vendor information)
* `contract_bid_items` (Items that are on the contract with different unit prices depending on contractor)
* `contractor_inspections` (table that tracks the inspection status information)
* `contractor_materials_log` (table that tracks what items "materials" were used in the assigned project)
* `contractor_work_order` (table that has all pertinent work order information)

#### Existing tables used

* `work_orders_signs_markings_attachments` (for inspection photo images)
* `work_orders_signs_markings_time_logs` (bc Kati A. was already pulling date from Work History page and the existing date resided in this object table)

**Connections**

* **street\_names** (for contractor work order object - Street, From/To Street in order to not have typos on location names.
* **accounts** (audit fields: Created Date/By, Modified Date/By)
